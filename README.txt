Additional report

For the custom report, I chose to display the number of appointments per Country. I chose to have sql do all the work and created a query that contains inner joins which combines three tables and spits out two columns (Country and count). The query is complicated but made the java side was very simple and I was able to pull this information into a tableview to present the data.
How to run the program
As the program starts, a login screen is presented. The user will be required to have a valid username and password that matches information in a mysql database. This program requires java 11 and has not been tested with any other jvm.
